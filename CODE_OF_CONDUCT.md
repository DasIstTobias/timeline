# RandomBytes Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We're committed to making this project a friendly, welcoming, and safe space for everyone – regardless of experience level, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, appearance, body size, ethnicity, age, religion, nationality, or other characteristics.

This is a small community, and we want to keep it relaxed and enjoyable for all contributors.

## Our Standards

### What we encourage:

* **Be kind and respectful** – Treat others how you'd like to be treated
* **Be patient** – We all have different experience levels and backgrounds
* **Give constructive feedback** – Focus on ideas and code
* **Welcome different perspectives** – There's often more than one way to solve a problem
* **Help others learn** – Share your knowledge and support newcomers
* **Have fun** – This is a personal project, and we're here because we enjoy it

### What we won't tolerate:

* Harassment, bullying, or intimidation of any kind
* **Racist, sexist, ableist, or otherwise discriminatory behaviour**
* **Discrimination or offensive language based on gender, gender identity, gender expression, sexual orientation, or related characteristics**
* **Queerphobia, transphobia, homophobia, or any form of LGBTQIA+ discrimination**
* Personal attacks or insults directed at other contributors
* Deliberate exclusion of individuals or groups
* Publishing others' private information without permission
* Unwelcome sexual attention or advances
* Trolling or sustained disruption of discussions
* Misgendering people deliberately or refusing to use someone's correct pronouns

**To be clear:** Everyone is welcome here regardless of who they are or who they love. Discrimination against LGBTQIA+ individuals, women, people of colour, disabled people, or any other marginalised group will result in immediate action.

### What's fine:

* Casual language and a relaxed tone
* Off-topic conversations (within reason)
* Jokes and humour (as long as they're not at someone else's expense)
* Disagreeing with ideas or approaches (respectfully)
* Making mistakes – we all do!

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies to all project spaces, including:
* GitHub issues, pull requests, and discussions
* Code reviews and comments
* Any other communication channels related to the project

**It also applies when representing the project in public spaces.**

## Enforcement

If you experience or witness behaviour that makes you uncomfortable or violates this Code of Conduct, please contact the project maintainer at **contact@randombytes.eu**.

All reports will be reviewed and investigated. Your privacy will be respected, and the situation will be handled as discreetly as possible.

### What happens if someone breaks the rules?

This is a small community, so we'll keep things simple:

1. **First time** (for minor issues): A friendly reminder about our standards
2. **Continued behaviour or more serious violations**: A formal warning and temporary restriction from participating in the project
3. **Serious violations (including discrimination and harassment) or repeated violations**: Permanent ban from the project

The severity of the response will match the severity of the violation. Discriminatory behaviour, harassment, and queerphobia will be treated seriously and may result in immediate removal from the project.

## A Note on Collaboration

* **Design decisions** take time and involve trade-offs. There's rarely a perfect solution.
* **Constructive contributions** are always welcome. If you have ideas, open an issue or submit a pull request.
* **Experiments are encouraged** – fork the project, try things out, and share what you learn.
* **Questions are welcome** – there are no (perhaps a few but mostly no) silly questions, and we're happy to help.

## Attribution

This Code of Conduct is inspired by the [Rust Code of Conduct](https://www.rust-lang.org/policies/code-of-conduct) and the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org).

*Remember: This is meant to be an enjoyable project for everyone involved. Let's keep it that way.*
