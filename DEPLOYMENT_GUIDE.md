# SRP Authentication System - Deployment Guide

## Overview

This guide covers deploying the new SRP-6a authentication system to production. This is a **breaking change** that requires a clean migration from the old bcrypt system.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

1. **No Backwards Compatibility**: Existing users will need to have their passwords reset
2. **Clean Migration**: Old password_hash column has been replaced with srp_salt and srp_verifier
3. **Admin Password**: Will be auto-generated on first startup and saved to `admin_credentials.txt`

## Pre-Deployment Checklist

- [ ] Backup existing database
- [ ] Notify users of maintenance window
- [ ] Test deployment in staging environment
- [ ] Prepare communication for password reset process
- [ ] Review SECURITY_AUDIT.md

## Database Migration

### Option 1: Fresh Installation (Recommended for new deployments)

```bash
# Run the init.sql script
psql -U timeline_user -h localhost -d timeline -f database/init.sql
```

This will create:
- Users table with `srp_salt` and `srp_verifier` columns
- Admin user with placeholder credentials (updated on first backend startup)
- All other tables

### Option 2: Migration from Existing System (Production upgrade)

```sql
-- Backup first!
-- Then run this migration:

BEGIN;

-- Add new SRP columns
ALTER TABLE users 
  ADD COLUMN srp_salt VARCHAR(255),
  ADD COLUMN srp_verifier TEXT;

-- Remove old password_hash column
ALTER TABLE users 
  DROP COLUMN password_hash;

-- Make SRP columns NOT NULL (after data migration)
-- Note: You'll need to reset all user passwords or generate them
UPDATE users SET 
  srp_salt = '$placeholder$',
  srp_verifier = '$placeholder$';

ALTER TABLE users 
  ALTER COLUMN srp_salt SET NOT NULL,
  ALTER COLUMN srp_verifier SET NOT NULL;

COMMIT;
```

**Important**: After migration, users will need new passwords. You have two options:
1. Admin generates new passwords for all users (recommended for small user base)
2. Implement password reset flow for users to set new passwords

## Backend Deployment

### 1. Build the Application

```bash
cd backend
cargo build --release
```

### 2. Set Environment Variables

```bash
export DATABASE_URL="postgres://timeline_user:timeline_password@localhost:5432/timeline"
export RUST_LOG=info
export DOMAIN=yourdomain.com
export REQUIRE_TLS=true  # Recommended for production
export USE_SELF_SIGNED_SSL=false  # Use reverse proxy for TLS
```

### 3. Start the Backend

```bash
./target/release/timeline-backend
```

### 4. Retrieve Admin Credentials

On first startup, admin credentials are written to `admin_credentials.txt`:

```bash
cat admin_credentials.txt
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è Important**: Save these credentials securely and delete the file!

## Frontend Deployment

The frontend changes are already included in the static files. No separate deployment needed.

### Files Updated:
- `static/srp.js` - New SRP client library
- `static/crypto.js` - Added password hash derivation
- `static/app.js` - Updated login flow
- `static/index.html` - Added srp.js script

## Post-Deployment Verification

### 1. Admin Login Test

```bash
# Navigate to http://yourdomain.com
# Login with admin credentials from admin_credentials.txt
# Verify dashboard loads
```

### 2. User Registration Test

```bash
# As admin, create a new user
# Note the generated password
# Logout and login with new user credentials
```

### 3. Password Change Test

```bash
# As regular user, navigate to settings
# Change password
# Logout and login with new password
```

### 4. 2FA Test (if applicable)

```bash
# As regular user, enable 2FA
# Scan QR code
# Enter TOTP code
# Logout and login with 2FA
```

## Monitoring

### Key Metrics to Monitor

1. **Authentication Success Rate**
```bash
# Check logs for:
grep "SRP verification failed" /var/log/timeline/backend.log
```

2. **Session Creation Rate**
```bash
# Monitor session table growth
```

3. **Rate Limiting Triggers**
```bash
# Check for rate limit events
grep "rate limit" /var/log/timeline/backend.log
```

### Health Checks

```bash
# Check if server is responding
curl http://localhost:8080/

# Check database connectivity
psql -U timeline_user -h localhost -d timeline -c "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM users;"
```

## Rollback Plan

If issues arise, you can rollback to the previous version:

### 1. Restore Database Backup

```bash
psql -U timeline_user -h localhost -d timeline < backup.sql
```

### 2. Deploy Previous Backend Version

```bash
# Stop current backend
pkill timeline-backend

# Start previous version
./timeline-backend-old
```

### 3. Restore Previous Frontend Files

```bash
# Copy from backup
cp -r backup/static/* static/
```

## Security Considerations

### TLS/HTTPS

- **Highly Recommended**: Always use HTTPS in production
- Set `REQUIRE_TLS=true` in environment
- Use a reverse proxy (nginx, Caddy) for TLS termination

### Database Security

- Use strong database passwords
- Restrict database access to application server only
- Enable PostgreSQL SSL connections
- Regular database backups

### Rate Limiting

- Monitor rate limiting logs
- Adjust limits based on usage patterns
- Consider adding IP-based blocks for persistent attackers

### Session Security

- Cookies are HttpOnly and SameSite=Strict (already configured)
- Consider adding Secure flag for HTTPS deployments
- Monitor session expiration settings

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Admin credentials not generated

**Solution**: Check that admin user exists in database:
```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'admin';
```

### Issue: Login fails immediately

**Solution**: Check browser console for JavaScript errors. Verify srp.js is loading:
```bash
curl http://yourdomain.com/static/srp.js
```

### Issue: 2FA not working

**Solution**: Verify password hash derivation is working. Check that TOTP secrets are encrypted properly in database.

### Issue: Database connection fails

**Solution**: Verify DATABASE_URL environment variable and PostgreSQL is running:
```bash
pg_isready -h localhost -p 5432
```

## Support

For issues or questions:
1. Check SECURITY_AUDIT.md for security-related questions
2. Review NEW_AUTH_PLAN.md for implementation details
3. Check application logs: `tail -f /var/log/timeline/backend.log`

## Success Criteria

‚úÖ Admin can login  
‚úÖ New users can be created  
‚úÖ Users can login  
‚úÖ Password changes work  
‚úÖ 2FA setup works  
‚úÖ Session management works  
‚úÖ No security vulnerabilities  
‚úÖ All features accessible  

## Conclusion
